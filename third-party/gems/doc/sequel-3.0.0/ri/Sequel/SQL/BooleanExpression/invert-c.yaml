  body: Invert the expression, if possible. If the expression cannot be inverted, raise an error. An inverted expression should match everything that the uninverted expression did not match, and vice-versa, except for possible issues with SQL NULL (i.e. 1 == NULL is NULL and 1 != NULL is also NULL).
