- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Returns the columns in the result set in order. If the columns are currently cached, returns the cached value. Otherwise, a SELECT query is performed to get a single row. Adapters are expected to fill the columns cache with the column information when a query is performed. If the dataset does not have any rows, this may be an empty array depending on how the adapter is programmed.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If you are looking for all columns for a single table and maybe some information about each column (e.g. type), see Database#schema.
