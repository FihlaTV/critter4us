  body: The database type for this database object, the same as the adapter scheme by default. Should be overridden in adapters (especially shared adapters) to be the correct type, so that even if two separate Database objects are using different adapters you can tell that they are using the same database type. Even better, you can tell that two Database objects that are using the same adapter are connecting to different database types (think JDBC or DataObjects).
