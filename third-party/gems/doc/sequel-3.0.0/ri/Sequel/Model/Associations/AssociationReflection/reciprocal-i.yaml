  body: Returns the reciprocal association variable, if one exists. The reciprocal association is the association in the associated class that is the opposite of the current association. For example, Album.many_to_one :artist and Artist.one_to_many :albums are reciprocal associations. This information is to populate reciprocal associations. For example, when you do this_artist.add_album(album) it sets album.artist to this_artist.
