  body: Sets value of the column's attribute and marks the column as changed. If the column already has the same value, this is a no-op. Note that changing a columns value and then changing it back will cause the column to appear in changed_columns. Similarly, providing a value that is different from the column's current value but is the same after typecasting will also cause changed_columns to include the column.
