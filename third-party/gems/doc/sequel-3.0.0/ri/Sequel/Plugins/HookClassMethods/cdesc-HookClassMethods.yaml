  body: "Sequel's built-in hook class methods plugin is designed for backwards compatibility. Its use is not encouraged, it is recommended to use instance methods and super instead of this plugin. What this plugin allows you to do is, for example:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  # Block only, can cause duplicate hooks if code is reloaded\n  before_save{self.created_at = Time.now}\n  # Block with tag, safe for reloading\n  before_save(:set_created_at){self.created_at = Time.now}\n  # Tag only, safe for reloading, calls instance method\n  before_save(:set_created_at)\n"

  body: "Pretty much anything you can do with a hook class method, you can also do with an instance method instead:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "   def before_save\n     return false if super == false\n     self.created_at = Time.now\n   end\n"
