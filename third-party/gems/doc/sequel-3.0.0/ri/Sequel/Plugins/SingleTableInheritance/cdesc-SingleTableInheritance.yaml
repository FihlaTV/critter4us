comment: 
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Sequel's built in Single Table Inheritance plugin makes subclasses of this model only load rows where the given key field matches the subclass's name. If the key given has a NULL value or there are any problems looking up the class, uses the current class.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You should only use this in the parent class, not in the subclasses.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You shouldn't call set_dataset in the model after applying this plugin, otherwise subclasses might use the wrong dataset.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The filters and row_proc that sti_key sets up in subclasses may not work correctly if those subclasses have further subclasses. For those middle subclasses, you may need to call set_dataset manually with the correct filter and row_proc.
