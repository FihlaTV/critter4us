- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Lets you create a Model subclass with its dataset already set. source can be an existing dataset or a symbol (in which case it will create a dataset using the default database with the given symbol as the table name).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The purpose of this method is to set the dataset automatically for a model class, if the table name doesn't match the implicit name. This is neater than using set_dataset inside the class, doesn't require a bogus query for the schema, and allows it to work correctly in a system that uses code reloading.
